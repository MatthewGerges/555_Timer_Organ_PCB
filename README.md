- This PCB uses a 555 timer to generate sounds part of the diatonic scale on a piano. 
- One of the resistors used to set the frequency of the clock signal is fixed. 
- The resistor whose connected momentary switch is pressed acts as the other element that dictates the frequency of the clock signal. 
- The output of the clock then feeds to an NPN transistor that acts as an audio amplifier. 
- The amplified signal is then run through a speaker so the user can hear the piano note.
